# Web_Scrapping

## What Is Webscraping:
Web scraping (or data scraping) is a technique used to collect content and data from the internet. This data is usually saved in a local file so that it can be manipulated and analyzed as needed. If you’ve ever copied and pasted content from a website into an Excel spreadsheet, this is essentially what web scraping is, but on a very small scale.

However, when people refer to ‘web scrapers,’ they’re usually talking about software applications. Web scraping applications (or ‘bots’) are programmed to visit websites, grab the relevant pages and extract useful information. By automating this process, these bots can extract huge amounts of data in a very short time. This has obvious benefits in the digital age, when big data—which is constantly updating and changing—plays such a prominent role.

In this POC project mostly focused on web navigation and learned how to extract the data from the web/URL's.
1. Parsed Github topics and trendings URL using html parser.
2. the Html page get parsed using beautifulSoup coz, It provides a set of well defined methods for extracting information contained within HTML tags in a website.
3. after inspecting the webpage and going under the tags using findall() gave the informative data.
4. After collecting topics and trendings data this get converted into .csv file so that data become analytics/industry ready.
