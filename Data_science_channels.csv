2,Ken Jee,"Data Science and Sports Analytics are my passions. My name is Ken Jee and I have been working in the data science field doing sports analytics for the last 5 years. I have held data science positions in companies ranging from startups to fortune 100 organizations.  I transitioned into data science from a business and consulting background. When I was first starting out on my data science journey I was extremely lost; there were very few resources for me to learn about this field from. I decided to start making YouTube videos to share my experiences and to hopefully help others get break into the data science and sports analytics fields. 

On this channel I produce fun and informative Data Science and Sports Analytics Content. My goal is to provide insight into the data science community, career advice, and sports related analysis.

9,StatQuest with Josh Starmer,"Statistics, Machine Learning and Data Science can sometimes seem like very scary topics, but since each technique is really just a combination of small and simple steps, they are actually quite simple. My goal with StatQuest is to break down the major methodologies into easy to understand pieces. That said, I don't dumb down the material. Instead, I build up your understanding so that you are smarter.
